Introduction

Machine learning algorithms have been greatly successful and widely deployed. Yet, they are typically developed, evaluated, and analyzed assuming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data. These carefully curated datasets rarely capture the range and messiness of real world data. Enabling automated systems to be robust to the ever-changing shifts present in real world data remains a critical goal of machine learning systems. 

Our paper[cite] focuses on label shift[cite] or prior probability shift (Amos, 2008), and it corresponds to anti-causal learning (i.e. predicting the cause y from its effects x). Anti-causal learning is appropriate for diagnosing diseases given observations of symptoms because diseases cause symptoms. In this example, a pandemic would induce a shift in p(y); there would be a surge in cases. However, the process generating x given y is fixed (p_s(x|y) = p_t(x|y)); the symptoms generated by the disease do not change. An automated diagnostic system should cope with the difference in the baseline prevalence of the disease and adjust its predictions accordingly.
